<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
A rock, paper, scissors game build using HTML, CSS and JavaSript. This site is intended to allow the user to select one of three buttons: rock, paper or scissors. This selection and subsequent click will signal the Javascript to generate it's own random choice. Those two choices are then compared. The scoreboard will then showcase the user's choice, the Javascript random choice and the result of the game.

<b>Colour Palette</b>
<p>The colour scheme that I choose for the buttons of this project is a simple mix of red, blue and green. I choose this selection of colours because they are easy to see and they are complimentary. I used a light grey to define the background of the game-area and a darker grey for the text as I believe these grey shade go well with the bold colour selection of the buttons. </p>

<h3>Typograpghy</h3>

The fonts used in this project were imported into the css from google fonts. I choose Robot as a main font because it is both professional and positive. I choose Sans-sarif as back-up font because it is understated and friendly.

<b>Text content</b>

The text for the rules section of Rock, Paper, Scissors were taken from the webpage 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' on the website 'Play and Playground Encyclopedia':
